## Convolution
A convolution is a filter that passes over an image, processes it, and extracts features that show a commonality in the image

## Pooling
As well as using convolutions, pooling helps us greatly in detecting features. The goal is to reduce the overall amount of information in an image while maintaining the features that are detected as present.There are a number of different types of pooling, example MAX pooling.
